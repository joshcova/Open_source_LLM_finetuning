   Conclusion
	
   Ladies and Gentlemen,
	
   My proposal for a countercyclical fiscal capacity at the EMU level is far from technical. In fact, it is about providing a rule-based response to a deep concern of our fellow Europeans as shown by the way they voted in the latest European elections. 
	
   If the Member States are to gain more autonomy and a greater ability to bolster their economies against a cyclical downturn, this requires more European integration, in particular by equipping the monetary union with a scheme for limited sharing of fiscal risks €“ essentially a form of insurance.",prescriptive,prescriptive

accused of protectionism just because it applies specific health, plant health
or technical rules on access to its market, just as another cannot be accused of
dumping simply because it sells its products at lower prices than other
countries as a result of, say, lower labour costs. In practice, and contrary to what is widely believed, there has been no
inexorable standardisation or dilution of collective preferences as a result of
globalisation. Any convergence of such preferences has been uneven at most and

Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is a pleasure for me to open this conference and I would like, first of all, to thank Ms Ana Palacio, Chairman of the Legal Affairs and Internal Market Committee of the European Parliament, for taking this initiative to encourage a thorough debate about the legal framework for the information society.

By removing such protection in e-commerce disputes this will not only have an overwhelmingly negative impact on consumer confidence but also may have repercussions on the Single Market:

The maximum level of 50% has been chosen principally on the basis of the
following three elements:

a)  the precedents of the other Commission group exemptions (10%, 20%,
25% maximum), the test of the trade share being very similar to the
one of the market share contained in these regulations;

b)  the fact that even if one takes into account the specificities of the
maritime transport sector (high fixed and investment costs as well as
a certain degree of fleet mobility) in the calculation of the maximum
trade share, it would be difficult to accept that they should in
principle be higher than 50% having regard to the jurisprudence of
the Court of Justice according to which a market share of 50%
constitutes by itself, in the absence of exceptional circumstances,
the proof of a dominant position (see Akzo Judgment of 3 July 1991);
it would be difficult automatically to exempt a dominant position;

c)  the wish of the Commission that the exemption should cover a
significant number of consortia. 
Although we have now said it many times, it is worth repeating that under
this system not one consortium will be automatically prohibited provided of
course that it falls into one of these categories. The market share limits

   Background to competition policy

   Competition  policy has so long been a central Community policy, that  it
   is often forgotten that it is not an end in itself but rather one of  the
   instruments  towards  the  fundamental goals laid out in  the  Treaty   -
    namely  the  establishment  of a common  market,  the  approximation  of

   economic  policy,  the promotion of harmonious development  and  economic
   expansion,  the  increase of living standards and the bringing  about  of
   closer relationship between Member States.

In an initial communication on social protection in Europe, adopted in October 1995, the Commission proposed a framework for debate at Community level, identifying a number of issues considered important for discussion by the Council of Ministers of the European Union, the national authorities, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee, the European social partners and non-governmental organisations (consulted within the framework of the European Social Policy Forum held in Brussels in March 1996). _____________________
